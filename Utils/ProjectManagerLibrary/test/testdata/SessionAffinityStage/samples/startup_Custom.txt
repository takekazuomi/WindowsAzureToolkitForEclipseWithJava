@REM *** Sample startup script containing the steps for starting a custom server and deploying a WAR file. 
@REM *** $TODO: Modify this sample template as needed to create deployment script for an arbitrary server

@REM To use the sample, follow these steps:
@REM *** 1) Copy all this content into approot/startup.cmd in the role folder, close this file, and edit the copy
@REM *** 2) Place a JRE distribution as jre.zip under approot
@REM *** 3) Place a server distribution as server.zip under approot in your project
@REM *** 3.1) If you want to download the server into Azure directly from a URL instead, then
@REM          uncomment the next line and modify the URL as appropriate:
@REM cscript "util\download.vbs" "http://???/???.zip" "server.zip"

@REM *** 4) Update SERVER_DIR_NAME below as appropriate:
@REM *** (IMPORTANT: There must be no trailing nor leading whitespace around the setting)

SET SERVER_DIR_NAME=server_dir_name

@REM *** 5) To deploy your own WAR file, place it in approot and update WAR_NAME below:
@REM *** (IMPORTANT: There must be no trailing nor leading whitespace around the setting)

SET WAR_NAME=HelloWorld.war
