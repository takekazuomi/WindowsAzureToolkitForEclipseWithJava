:: *** Sample startup script containing the steps for starting a custom server and deploying a WAR file. 
:: *** $TODO: Modify this sample template as needed to create deployment script for an arbitrary server

:: To use the sample, follow these steps:
:: 1) Copy all this content into approot/startup.cmd in the role folder, close this file, and edit the copy
:: 2) Place a JDK distribution as jdk.zip under approot
:: 3) Place a server distribution as server.zip under approot in your project
::    3.1) If you want to download the server into Azure directly from a URL instead, then
::         uncomment the next line and modify the URL as appropriate:
:: cscript /NoLogo "util\download.vbs" "http://???/???.zip" "server.zip"

:: 4) Update SERVER_DIR_NAME below as appropriate:
::    (IMPORTANT: There must be no trailing nor leading whitespace around the setting)

SET SERVER_DIR_NAME=server_dir_name

:: 5) To deploy your own WAR file, place it in approot and update WAR_NAME below:
::    (IMPORTANT: There must be no trailing nor leading whitespace around the setting)

SET WAR_NAME=HelloWorld.war

			
:: *************************************************************************************
:: *** Edit and expand this script as appropriate to deploy your server and application.

:: Deploy JDK
set JAVA_HOME=\%ROLENAME%\jdk
set PATH=%PATH%;%JAVA_HOME%\bin
cscript /NoLogo util\unzip.vbs jdk.zip "%CD%"

:: Deploy server
:: set SERVER_HOME=???
cscript /NoLogo util\unzip.vbs server.zip "%CD%"

:: Deploy application
:: copy %WAR_NAME% "%SERVER_HOME%\???"

:: Start server
:: cd /d "%SERVER_HOME%\???"
:: cmd /c ???  OR start ???
