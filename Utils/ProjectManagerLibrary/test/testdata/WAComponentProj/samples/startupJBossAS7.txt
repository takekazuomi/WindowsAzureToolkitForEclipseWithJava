:: *** Sample startup script containing the steps for starting JBoss Application Server 7 and deploying a WAR file. 
:: *** (Last tested with JBoss Application Server 7.1.0)

:: To use the sample, follow these steps:
:: 1) Copy all this content into approot/startup.cmd in the role folder, close this file, and edit the copy
:: 2) Place a JDK distribution as jdk.zip under approot
:: 3) Place a JBoss Application Server 7 distribution as jboss7.zip under approot in your project
::    3.1) If you want to download the server into Azure directly from a URL instead, then
::         uncomment the next line and modify the URL as appropriate:
:: cscript /NoLogo "util\download.vbs" "http://download.jboss.org/jbossas/7.1/jboss-as-7.1.0.Final/jboss-as-7.1.0.Final.zip" "jboss7.zip"

:: 4) Update SERVER_DIR_NAME below as appropriate:
::    (IMPORTANT: There must be no trailing nor leading whitespace around the setting)

SET SERVER_DIR_NAME=jboss-as-7.1.0.Final

:: 5) To deploy your own WAR file, place it in approot and update WAR_NAME below:
::    (IMPORTANT: There must be no trailing nor leading whitespace around the setting)

SET WAR_NAME=HelloWorld.war

:: 6) To enable the management console, add an input endpoint 9990/9990 to your Windows Azure configuration
