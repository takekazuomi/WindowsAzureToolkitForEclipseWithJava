      <!-- Create a Windows Azure deployment package
		    
			Attributes:

			packagefilename:
					(Required) The name, including the extension but not the full path, of the deployment package or 
					folder to be built. By convention, if creating a package file for deployment to the cloud 
					(packagetype="cloud"), use the *.cspkg extension. If creating only a directory layout for local 
					testing in the development fabric (packagetype="True"), use the *.csx extension.

			[configurationfilename]:
					The name, including the extension but not the full path, of the cloud service configuration file (*.cscfg).
					This file must exist in the root directory of the project (see the projectDir attribute). 
					If not specified, the default name "ServiceConfiguration.cscfg" will be assumed.
			
			[definitionfilename]:
					The name, including the extension but not the full path, of the cloud service definition file (*.csdef). 
					This file must exist in the root directory of the project (see the projectdir attribute).
					If not specified, the default name "ServiceDefinition.csdef" is assumed.

			[emulatortoolsdir]:
					The directory where the emulator tools will be created by the build process.
					If not specified, the default "emulatorTools" directory in the project directory 
					will be used.

			[packagedir]: 
					The target directory of the deployment package file or folder. 
					If not specified, "<projectdir>/deploy" will be used.

			[packagetype = {cloud | local}]
					cloud:	(default) Builds a package file for deployment to the Windows Azure cloud, for example via the Windows 
							Azure management portal.
					local:	Creates a package directory layout for local testing in the Windows Azure Compute 
							Emulator and a command script (csrun.cmd) for you to start your cloud service in the development 
							fabric more easily.

			[projectdir]:
					The root directory of the project. The service definition (*.csdef) and service configuration (*.cscfg) 
					files are expected to exist there. If not specified, the task will attempt to determine the project 
					directory automatically.

			[sdkdir]: 
					The directory of the cspack.exe tool. If not specified, an attempt will be made to find it automatically.
			
			[emulatordir]:
					The directory of the Windows Azure Emulator installation. If not specified, an attempt will be made to find it automatically.

			[usectppackageformat]:
					If set to true and packagetype=cloud, then the package is built in OPC file format, supported by Windows Azure SDK v1.7 and later.

			[rolepropertiesfilename]:
					The file name of a properties file in the project to associate with each role.
			
			[portalurl]:
					The URL of the Windows Azure portal used to generate the shortcut link

			[verifydownloads = {true | false}]
					true:	(default) Verifies the download URLs of components that have cloudsrc specified when building for the cloud
					false:	Disables download URL verification

					Windows Azure based on the specified settings. A component can also represent a commandline when used with deploymethod='exec'	    
				
					Attributes:
	
					[importsrc]:
							The file or directory path from which the component will be imported, relative to approot.
					
					[importmethod = {none | copy | zip | auto}]:
							none:	(default) No import action is taken. The component is assumed to be already in the approot or to be a commandline. 
							auto:	The same as 'none', but this value could be overloaded by external builders to have special meaning.
							copy: 	Copies from the path provided in importsrc into the approot.
							zip:	Zips the file or directory at the path provided in importsrc and places the zip file into the approot.
							
					[importas]:
							The name under which the component will be imported into the approot. It can be a directory name if importing
							a directory, or a file name if importing files. If not specified and no importmethod is 'none', then this is 
							assumed to be the same as importsrc
		
					[deploymethod = {none | copy | unzip | exec}]:
							none:	(default) No deployment action is taken. 
							copy:	Copies the file or directory specified by importas from the approot into the directory specified by deploydir
							unzip:	Unzips the file specified by importas from the approot into the directory specified by deploydir
							exec:	Interprets importas as a command line and executes it during deployment in the working directory specified by deploydir
							
					[deploydir]:
							The directory, relative to approot, into which the component will be deployed based on deploymethod.
					
					[cloudsrc]:
							The URL of the file representing this component that will be downloaded when deploying in the cloud (not emulator). 
							This will prevent the component from getting included in the package.
					
					[cloudkey]:
							An access key for the storage account the blob is in, if cloudsrc points to a private Windows Azure Blob
							If not specified, the cloudsrc URL is assumed to be publicly available.
					
					[cloudmethod = {none | copy | unzip | exec}]
							(This setting is applicable only if cloudsrc is specified)
							none: 	(default) The same deployment method will be applied to the downloaded file as the one specified by deploymethod.
							copy:	Copies the downloaded file into the directory specified by deploydir
							unzip: 	Unzips the downloaded file into the directory specified by deploydir
							exec:	Executes the downloaded file in the working directory specified by deploydir (commandline parameters are not supported)
							
					[cloudupload = {never | auto | always}]
							(This setting is applicable only if cloudsrc and cloudkey are specified and the package is built for the cloud, not  the emulator)
							never:	(default) The component specified by importsrc will be included in the package based on the selected importmethod
							auto:	The component specified by importsrc will not be included in the package. The following deployment logic will be followed:
							        - if the component is available at the location specified by cloudsrc, it will be deployed from there. 
							        - else, if cloudaltsrc is provided and the download is available there, it will be deployed from there and also copied 
							          into the Windows Azure Blob storage location specified by cloudsrc for future deployments. 
							        - else, the component will be uploaded by the build process into blob specified by cloudsrc.
							always:	The component specified by importsrc will not be included in the package, but will always be uploaded by the build process
									into the Windows Azure Blob storage location specified by cloudsrc and cloudkey, regardless of whether it already exists at
									that location or not.
									
					[cloudaltsrc]:
							If a download from the URL in cloudsrc fails, a download from this alternative URL will be attempted.
